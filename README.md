## Background
Here talk a little about what this web application does, why do I want to create this application.
Then talk about the language and framework use, this web application is built using python with flask.
The database used in this application is sqlite3.

## Video
Here is a video of me presenting the application. Please have a look! <link>

## Pythonanywhere
So, I have deployed my very first web application using pythonanywhere, please feel free to give it a try!
More than welcome to hear reviews from you all.

## Improvement
1. Notification feature will be great. (will definitely look into it)
2. Now the time frame has been hard coded divided into 1 hour slot starting from 8am to 10pm (should let user to decide how do they want to divide their time)
3. For now, the application only user to plan their task for "today" only, they are not able to plan their routine "tomorrow"
4. Finally, the design or "aesthetic" of the application can be improved!
