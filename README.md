# mytime-myresponsibility

The name of this web application is called My Time - My Responsibility and it is built as my CS50 final project.

## Background

As the name suggests, the theme of this web application is time management. Many successful individuals emphasize the importance of time management in order to be more productive. This give me the idea to build this application which will serve as a platform for users to plan and organize their day. The server side of this application is built using **Python with Flask** and the database used is **Sqlite3**. **Javascript and jQuery** are used to make the application more dynamic and interactive while **CSS** to make it more appealing. This is my very first self-built web application and I have deployed it using *pythonanywhere*, welcome to give my application a try by following this link, [mytime-myresponsibility](http://marcushwz.pythonanywhere.com/) .

## Video

I have posted a video on youtube introducing this web application. Feel free to have a look through this link, [video](https://youtu.be/c6YiyP2a2Pc), and I am more than happy to hear from you guys! Cheers

## Future Work
1. It will be better if this application has notification functions, where it can send desktop notification to the user 5 minutes before the task begins and ends.
2. More flexible in term of planning and organizing (Currently the application only allows users to plan for "today" not "tomorrow" and the time blocks has been fixed at one hour interval starting from 8am to 10pm).
3. Aesthetic, it might not look "great" now!
